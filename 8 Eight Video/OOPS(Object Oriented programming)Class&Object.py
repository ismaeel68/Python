#(OOPS in python) To map with real world scenarios,we started using object in code.
#(Class & Object) in python 
#Class is a blue print for creating object.
class Student: #This is a class 
    name="Karan"
S1 = Student()#This is a object
print(S1.name)

s2 = Student()
print(s2.name)

class Car:
    color="Black"
    brand="Mercedes"
car1 = Car
print(car1.color)
print(car1.brand)
#(Constructor)
